# WeatherApp
A simple weather app that let's the user set see the current weather of any given valid location

Currently, it is not hosted anywhere so I'm unable to let users check the weather. But I will soon launch this mini-project, and improve upon it to let users see the time 
in the location they've selected and having a little widget for the weather the city is having (i.e clouds, rain, and so on).
