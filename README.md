Weather App
A simple weather app that allows the user to view the current weather of any valid location.

Description
This mini-project is a weather app that lets users check the current weather of any location. Currently, it is not hosted anywhere, so users are unable to check the weather. However, I have plans to launch it soon and make further improvements to include features such as displaying the time in the selected location and adding a widget to show the weather conditions (e.g., clouds, rain, etc.) for the city.

Features
View current weather of any valid location.
Planned feature: Display time in the selected location.
Planned feature: Add a weather widget to show weather conditions for the city.
Technologies Used
Front-end: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Back-end: N/A (planned integration with a weather API)
Deployment: To be determined (TBD)
Installation
To run the app locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository.
Open the index.html file in a web browser.
